# Nyan Cat on OLED Display - Arduino Nano Sketch

This sketch is quite easy, I used Arduino Nano with OLED 0.96″ display 128×64 resolution to run this animation. I will not deep dive into connecting the OLED display since I guess this is too easy and there are numerous tutorial online available, but I would like to share the code.

## Requirements
- Adafruit SSD1306 Library
- Adafruit GFX Library
